 Oh Britannia, my pretty Brittany I dedicate this little song to you You're well mounted like a mountain chain You're well rolled like a galette in Jean Vaud And if I could take you to Spain For a little vacation At the seashore in a champagne ocean I'll try to drown the fish Oh Britannia, my pretty countryside Sometimes the sun is a little bright I didn't find more charming than Brittany Yet I explored some regions And if I could be the one who accompanies you Whether it's a moor or a lamb If one day I go out without champagne You'll be jealous and you'll be right Thank you, thank you
