 And this night so quiet My heart keeps looking for your gaze The echo of your laughter in my mind Tells me it's not too late I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being Every step I take, I take you with me In every breath, your name is a witness Time stops when you're close And in every dream, your love reverberates I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being Even if destiny doesn't separate us My heart will always find you In every note of this beat Our love will keep dancing non-stop I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being In every star that shines in the sky Reflected in my eyes, I want to walk I can't forget you, love Your kisses are still burning in my skin I can't deny it, my love You're the fire that burns my being In color
