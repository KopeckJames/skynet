 Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away. If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in Far Bombay. Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away. Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru. In Lama Land there's a one-man band and he'll toot his flute for you. Come fly with me, let's float down in the blues. And once I get you up there where the air is rarefied, we'll just fly. Sorry I, once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near. You will hear angels cheer because we're together. Weather-wise it's such a lovely day. You just say the words and we'll beat those birds down to Acapulco Bay. It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say. Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away.
