 I love you, I love you You all appreciate it When I was young me and my mama had beef 17 years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see a face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Spending through school, I'm scared to go home I was a fool with the big boys breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister Over the years we was poor, then other little kids And even though we had different daddies The same drama when things went wrong we blamed Mama, I reminisce on the stress I caused It was hell, hugging on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary Hey, I see the penitentiary one day Running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoop into my backside And even as a crack fiend Mama, you always was a black queen Mama, I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy Trying to raise a man, you always was committed A poor single mother on welfare Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You all appreciate it Dear mama, don't you know I love you Dear mama, please don't mind about a few Dear mama, I appreciate you Although my shadow's gone, I will never leave you Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love for my daddy cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless But all along I was looking for a father, he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out, started really hanging I needed money of my own so I started slinging I ain't guilty cause even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent's due Hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent you Cause when I was low you was there for me You never left me alone because you cared for me I see you coming home after work late You in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate You're just working with the scraps you was given And mama made miracles, every thanksgiving But now the world got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I could pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You all appreciate it Don't you know that I love you Dear mama, ladies come on above you And dear mama, I appreciate you Although I might have got a goal I will never leave you Pour out some liquor and I reminisce Cause through the trauma I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night There's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on There's no way I could pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You all appreciate it Don't you know that I love you Dear mama, ladies come on above you I appreciate you Although my shadow's gone I would never leave you I appreciate you I love you I need you I hate to pretend you I love you I love you I appreciate you I need you Oh mama I appreciate you I love you I need you Oh mama I love you I appreciate you I need you
